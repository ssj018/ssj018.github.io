# Cisco IP ACL Overview
## IP acl types
cisco IP acl has three types:
- Port acl:   
**An ACL is considered a port ACL when you apply it to one of the following:**  
  - Ethernet interface
  - Ethernet port-channel interface  

  *When a port ACL is applied to a trunk port, the ACL filters traffic on all VLANs on the trunk port.*

- Router ACL  
  - vlan interfaces(svi)
  - Physical layer 3 interfaces
  - Layer 3 Ethernet port-channel interfaces
  - Layer 3 Ethernet port-channel subinterfaces
  - Tunnels
  - Management interfaces

- VLAN ACL:  
An ACL is a VACL when you use an access map to associate the ACL with an action and then apply the map to a VLAN.

## IP acl Rules  
You can create rules in access-list configuration mode by using the permit or deny command. The device allows traffic that matches the criteria in a permit rule and blocks traffic that matches the criteria in a deny rule.   
**This section describes some of the options that you can use when you configure a rule:**  
- Source and Destination
- Protocols
- Implicit Rules
- Additional Filtering Options
- Sequence Numbers
- Logical Operators and Logical Operation Units
